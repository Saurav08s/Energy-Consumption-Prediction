# Energy-Consumption-Prediction

Project Overview

The Energy Consumption Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model to accurately forecast energy consumption based on historical data. This system helps in efficient energy management, cost savings, and sustainability efforts.

##Features

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Multiple Model Comparisons

Model Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R²

Predictive Analysis & Visualization

##Dataset

The dataset used for this project is in CSV format, containing the following key attributes:

Date/Time: Timestamp of recorded energy usage.
